## ðŸ”´ Major Inconsistencies

### 1. **Inconsistent Kustomize Structure**
- **FastAPI**: Has proper base + overlay structure but duplicates the entire deployment.yaml in prod overlay instead of using patches
- **Ingress**: Correctly uses base + patch approach
- **MinIO**: No base directory at all - everything is in prod overlay only
- **PostgreSQL**: Has base + overlay but again duplicates entire deployment.yaml

### 2. **Resource Placement Issues**
- Sealed secrets are scattered in multiple overlays instead of being centralized
- Some components have services in both base and overlay (FastAPI)
- MinIO has no base configuration to fall back on

### 3. **Namespace Inconsistencies**
- FastAPI deploys to `fastapi-prod` namespace
- Ingress also deploys to `fastapi-prod` namespace (should be its own or shared)
- MinIO deploys to `minio-prod` namespace
- PostgreSQL deploys to `postgres-prod` namespace

## ðŸŸ¡ Best Practice Violations

### 4. **Configuration Management**
- Hardcoded values mixed with configmaps (e.g., database name in configmap-patch)
- Empty configmaps in base that serve no purpose
- Database credentials stored in multiple sealed secrets across namespaces

### 5. **Secret Management**
- Duplicate sealed secrets for MinIO credentials in both `fastapi-prod` and `minio-prod` namespaces
- No clear secret sharing strategy between components

## âœ… Recommendations for Consistency

### 1. **Standardize Kustomize Pattern**
```
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ service-name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ configmap.yaml (if needed)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ overlays/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ prod/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ deployment-patch.yaml (not full deployment)
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ configmap-patch.yaml
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ sealed-secret.yaml
```

### 2. **Centralize Secrets**
Consider creating a shared namespace for secrets or use a secret management operator that can replicate secrets across namespaces.

### 3. **Consistent Patching**
Use strategic merge patches or JSON patches instead of replacing entire resources:

```yaml
# Instead of full deployment.yaml, use patches:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fastapi
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Only specify what changes
```

### 4. **Namespace Strategy**
Decide on a consistent approach:
- **Option A**: All components in one namespace (e.g., `glasgow-prod`)
- **Option B**: Separate namespaces but with consistent naming (`glasgow-fastapi`, `glasgow-minio`, etc.)

### 5. **Environment Structure**
Consider adding a clear environment hierarchy:
```
overlays/
â”œâ”€â”€ dev/
â”œâ”€â”€ staging/
â””â”€â”€ prod/
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions

1. **Standardize MinIO**: Create a proper base directory with common configuration
2. **Convert to patches**: Replace full resource definitions in overlays with patches
3. **Consolidate secrets**: Decide on a secret sharing strategy
4. **Consistent naming**: Align all component naming conventions
5. **Remove duplication**: Eliminate duplicate service definitions

I completely understand\! Getting Kustomize patches to work correctly can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you're just starting out. It's a common hurdle, and many people just switch to full file replacement because "it just works." But you're right, it's not the ideal long-term solution for maintainability.

The good news is that the "stuck for hours" feeling usually comes from a few common misunderstandings about how Kustomize expects patches to be structured. Let's break down the core issues you likely faced and how to fix them so you can confidently use patches.

-----

### The Heart of the Problem: Patch vs. Replace

The main issue in your current setup, as we discussed, is that you're listing files like `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment.yaml` under the `resources:` section of your `kustomization.yaml`. When Kustomize sees a file here that has the same `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata.name` as a resource in its base, it **replaces** the base resource entirely with the version from your overlay. It doesn't try to merge or patch it.

This means you lose the benefit of Kustomize's intelligent merging. You're effectively maintaining two full copies of your Deployment (one in base, one in prod overlay), which is error-prone and harder to manage as your application evolves.

-----

### Why Patches Are Tricky (and How to Make Them Work)

The `patchesStrategicMerge:` (or `patches:`) section tells Kustomize: "Hey, for the files listed here, please *merge* their content into existing resources that match their name, kind, and API version."

Here are the key things that trip people up with patches:

1.  **Correct `kustomization.yaml` Field:** You *must* use `patchesStrategicMerge:` for most common YAML-based patches (which yours are). If you use `resources:` or `patches:` (which is for JSON patches), Kustomize won't perform the strategic merge.

      * **Your Fix:**
        ```yaml
        # components/fastapi/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
        apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Kustomization
        bases:
          - ../../base # <-- IMPORTANT! Add this to reference the base
        # resources: # <-- REMOVE most things from here
          # - deployment.yaml # <-- REMOVE
          # - service.yaml    # <-- REMOVE

        # ADD patchesStrategicMerge for your modifications
        patchesStrategicMerge:
          - deployment-patch.yaml # Your renamed/reduced deployment patch
          - configmap-patch.yaml  # Your configmap patch
        # resources: # ONLY for new, standalone files not in base
        resources:
          - postgres-prod-sealed-secret.yaml
          - minio-prod-sealed-secret.yaml
        ```

2.  **Minimal Patch Content:** A patch file should **only contain the fields you want to change or add**. You don't need to repeat the entire manifest from the base. If you put the entire manifest in a file listed under `patchesStrategicMerge:`, it will still merge, but it makes your patches much harder to read and review.

      * **Your Fix Example (FastAPI Deployment):**

        ```yaml
        # components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml
        # This file is replacing your current components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment.yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: fastapi # MUST match the name in the base deployment
        spec:
          replicas: 2 # Only specify the change for replicas
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: fastapi # MUST match the container name
                image: hatchikin/glasgow-fastapi:prod # Change to a prod-specific tag!
                                                    # This is a key part of your prod overlay
        ```

3.  **Renaming for Clarity:** While Kustomize doesn't care about the filename, using a `*-patch.yaml` convention makes it immediately clear that the file is intended as a patch, not a full resource definition.

      * **Your Fix:** Rename `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment.yaml` to `deployment-patch.yaml` (or similar).

### Step-by-Step Refactoring Guide

Let's walk through FastAPI as an example, as it shares patterns with Postgres.

#### **FastAPI Refactor**

1.  **Clean up `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/`:**

      * **Rename `deployment.yaml`**: Change `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment.yaml` to `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml`.
      * **Reduce `deployment-patch.yaml` content**: Edit `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml` to *only* include the `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name`, and the `spec` fields you want to change.
          * Specifically, change `replicas: 2` and update the `image:` to a `prod`-specific tag if you have one, or just remove the `image` line if it's the same as base. For example:
            ```yaml
            # components/fastapi/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml
            apiVersion: apps/v1
            kind: Deployment
            metadata:
              name: fastapi
            spec:
              replicas: 2
              template:
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: fastapi
                    # Change image if you have a prod tag:
                    # image: hatchikin/glasgow-fastapi:prod
                    # Remove all other fields (ports, env, resources, probes)
                    # unless you explicitly want to change them from the base
            ```
      * **Remove `service.yaml`**: Delete `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/service.yaml`. Kustomize can handle the namespace for you.
      * **Keep `configmap-patch.yaml`**: The content is correct for a patch.
      * **Keep SealedSecrets**: `minio-prod-sealed-secret.yaml` and `postgres-prod-sealed-secret.yaml` are correctly new resources.

2.  **Update `components/fastapi/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`:**

    ```yaml
    # components/fastapi/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization

    # 1. Reference the base
    bases:
      - ../../base

    # 2. Add namespace transformer (replaces explicit service.yaml)
    namespace: fastapi-prod

    # 3. List your patches for existing resources
    patchesStrategicMerge:
      - deployment-patch.yaml
      - configmap-patch.yaml

    # 4. List your NEW resources specific to this overlay
    resources:
      - postgres-prod-sealed-secret.yaml
      - minio-prod-sealed-secret.yaml
    ```

#### **Ingress Refactor**

This one is super simple, you just had the wrong keyword:

1.  **Update `components/ingress/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`:**

    ```yaml
    # components/ingress/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization

    bases:
      - ../../base # Already there, good!

    # Change 'patches:' to 'patchesStrategicMerge:'
    patchesStrategicMerge:
      - ingress-patch.yaml
    ```

    (No change needed for `ingress-patch.yaml` itself, it's perfect.)

#### **MinIO Refactor**

This one needs creating the base structure first:

1.  **Create `components/minio/base/`:**

      * Create the directory: `mkdir -p components/minio/base`
      * **Move files**: Move `components/minio/overlays/prod/deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `pvc.yaml` into this new `components/minio/base/` directory.
      * **Create `components/minio/base/kustomization.yaml`**:
        ```yaml
        # components/minio/base/kustomization.yaml
        apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Kustomization
        resources:
          - deployment.yaml
          - service.yaml
          - pvc.yaml
        ```

2.  **Update `components/minio/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`:**

      * You don't currently have a separate MinIO `base` in your provided files, so the `prod` overlay is acting as the source. This is the main refactor needed here.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```yaml
    # components/minio/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization

    # 1. Reference the new base
    bases:
      - ../../base

    # 2. Add namespace transformer
    namespace: minio-prod

    # 3. Add patches for any differences in prod (if any)
    # If your prod deployment/pvc/service has no differences other than namespace,
    # then you don't need any patch files for them here.
    # patchesStrategicMerge:
    #   - minio-deployment-patch.yaml # Example if you needed to change replicas

    # 4. List your NEW resources specific to this overlay
    resources:
      - minio-prod-sealed-secret.yaml # This is correctly placed here
    ```

    *Note*: If your `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `pvc.yaml` in `components/minio/overlays/prod` were *identical* to what you moved to base, then you actually don't need patch files for them in `overlays/prod`. The `base` reference and `namespace` transformer are sufficient.

#### **Postgres Refactor**

Similar to FastAPI:

1.  **Clean up `components/postgres/overlays/prod/`:**

      * **Rename `deployment.yaml`**: Change `components/postgres/overlays/prod/deployment.yaml` to `components/postgres/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml`.
      * **Reduce `deployment-patch.yaml` content**: Edit `components/postgres/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml` to *only* include the `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name`, and the `spec` fields that change from the base.
          * This primarily means changing the `volumes` from `emptyDir` to `persistentVolumeClaim` and updating the `env` section to use `secretKeyRef` instead of literal `value` for credentials.
            ```yaml
            # components/postgres/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml
            apiVersion: apps/v1
            kind: Deployment
            metadata:
              name: postgres
            spec:
              template:
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: postgres
                    env:
                    - name: POSTGRES_DB
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: postgres-prod-sealed-secret
                          key: db
                    - name: POSTGRES_USER
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: postgres-prod-sealed-secret
                          key: username
                    - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: postgres-prod-sealed-secret
                          key: password
                    volumeMounts:
                    - name: postgres-storage
                      mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
                  volumes:
                  - name: postgres-storage
                    persistentVolumeClaim:
                      claimName: postgres-pvc # References the PVC patch/resource
            ```
      * **Remove `service.yaml`**: Delete `components/postgres/overlays/prod/service.yaml`. Use the namespace transformer.
      * **Rename `pvc.yaml`**: Change `components/postgres/overlays/prod/pvc.yaml` to `components/postgres/overlays/prod/pvc-patch.yaml`.
      * **Reduce `pvc-patch.yaml` content**:
        ```yaml
        # components/postgres/overlays/prod/pvc-patch.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
          name: postgres-pvc
        spec:
          accessModes: # Keep if different from base, otherwise remove
            - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 5Gi # This is the main change from emptyDir
          storageClassName: local-path # This is also a change from emptyDir base
        ```
      * **Remove `configmap-patch.yaml`**: Since your base `configmap.yaml` for Postgres is empty and your secrets are handled by `SealedSecret`, this patch file is redundant.

2.  **Update `components/postgres/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`:**

    ```yaml
    # components/postgres/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization

    # 1. Reference the base
    bases:
      - ../../base

    # 2. Add namespace transformer
    namespace: postgres-prod

    # 3. List your patches for existing resources
    patchesStrategicMerge:
      - deployment-patch.yaml
      - pvc-patch.yaml

    # 4. List your NEW resources specific to this overlay
    resources:
      - postgres-prod-sealed-secret.yaml
    ```

-----

### The Power of `kustomize build`

After making these changes, the most important step is to **test them**. Navigate to each `overlays/prod` directory and run:

```bash
kustomize build .
```

This command will show you the final, merged YAML output. Carefully examine it to ensure:

  * The `replicas` for FastAPI are `2`.
  * The `image` for FastAPI is the `prod` tag (if you set it).
  * The `host` for Ingress is `api.glasgow.local`.
  * Postgres uses the correct `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `storageClassName` instead of `emptyDir`.
  * All resources are in the correct `fastapi-prod`, `minio-prod`, or `postgres-prod` namespaces.
  * The `SealedSecrets` are present and correctly referenced.
  * There are no duplicate resources.

This might feel like a lot of steps, but once you get the hang of it, creating new `overlays/dev` will be incredibly fast and easy because you'll primarily be creating small patch files and updating the `kustomization.yaml` in the `dev` directory.

How does this clearer, step-by-step approach feel? Are there any specific parts you'd like to dive into further?
